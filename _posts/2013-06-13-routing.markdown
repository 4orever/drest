Usage

- if multiple routes are matched an exception is thrown

- If using the default service actions, any parameter defined in the route will be used as a filter

Route patterns

- wildcard routes (+)

paramters

additional conditionals
along with matching the route path you can also specify a conditional for each route parameter. 
If the condition is not met then the the route is not deemed a match

$app = new \Slim\Slim();
$app->get('/archive/:year', function ($year) {
    echo "You are viewing archives from $year";
})->conditions(array('year' => '(19|20)\d\d'));

    name="get_user",
    routePattern="/user/:id",
    routeConditions={"id": "\d+"},
    verbs={"GET"}
 )
